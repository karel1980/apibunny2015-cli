# Description

This is a CLI tool for browsing a zork-style game with a http+json API.
The game can be found at http://apibunny.com/

Don't worry, there are no grues in this maze.

# Usage:

Go to apibunny.com to get a maze uuid linked to your twitter account

python maze.py /mazes/{some-uuid}

The game will remember the maze argument, so it is only required on the first run
